Abstract
--------

Scientific and societal interest in the relationship between the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and U.S. East Coast sea level has intensified over the past decade, largely due to (1) projected, and potentially ongoing, enhancement of sea level rise associated with AMOC weakening and (2) the potential for observations of U.S. East Coast sea level to inform reconstructions of North Atlantic circulation and climate. These implications have inspired a wealth of model- and observation-based analyses. Here, we review this research, finding consistent support in numerical models for an antiphase relationship between AMOC strength and dynamic sea level. However, simulations exhibit substantial along-coast and intermodel differences in the amplitude of AMOC-associated dynamic sea level variability. Observational analyses focusing on shorter (generally less than decadal) timescales show robust relationships between some components of the North Atlantic large-scale circulation and coastal sea level variability, but the causal relationships between different observational metrics, AMOC, and sea level are often unclear. We highlight the importance of existing and future research seeking to understand relationships between AMOC and its component currents, the role of ageostrophic processes near the coast, and the interplay of local and remote forcing. Such research will help reconcile the results of different numerical simulations with each other and with observations, inform the physical origins of covariability, and reveal the sensitivity of scaling relationships to forcing, timescale, and model representation. This information will, in turn, provide a more complete characterization of uncertainty in relevant relationships, leading to more robust reconstructions and projections.

Plain Language Summary
----------------------

Sea level along the U.S. East Coast is influenced by changes in the density and currents of the North Atlantic Ocean. Indeed, there are simple theoretical considerations that relate indices of basin-scale flow to coastal sea level. Such a relationship could be leveraged to predict future sea level changes and coastal flooding given an expected change in climate and ocean circulation. Alternatively, it could be used to reconstruct ocean circulation from sea level measurements. This paper reviews the nature of this relationship and whether, and when, it is evident in climate models and observations. Although the current generation of large-scale climate and ocean models generally show an antiphase relationship between basin-scale ocean current strength and coastal sea level, the spatial pattern of sea level change differs from theory and between models. Supported by existing and emerging research, the authors hypothesize that these deviations result from important physical processes occurring on the continental shelf and slope, and the complexities of the 3-dimensional ocean circulation. A quantitative assessment of the importance of these processes is critical for understanding past and future climate and sea level changes in this heavily populated and vulnerable region.

Sea Level Variability Along the United States East Coast and Its Societal Importance
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The densely populated U.S. East Coast is especially vulnerable to the impacts of sea level change, with ~2.4 million people and ~1.4 million housing units between Maine and Florida less than 1 m above local mean high water (Strauss et al., 2012). Here, sea level rise is already having adverse environmental, societal, and economic consequences, including increases in the severity and frequency of coastal flooding (e.g., Ezer & Atkinson, 2014; Moftakhari et al., 2015; Ray & Foster, 2016; Sweet et al., 2018; Wdowinski et al., 2016). Regional rates of sea level rise, and their associated consequences, are projected to increase substantially over the coming century (Figure 1a; Brown et al., 2018; Dahl et al., 2017; Kopp et al., 2014; Little, Horton, Kopp, Oppenheimer, Yip, 2015; Ray & Foster, 2016; Vitousek et al., 2017).

   Figure 1: (a) Monthly mean tide gauge sea level (in millimeters relative to year 2000) at the Battery (New York City; blue line). Projections of relative sea level (RSL) change, relative to year 2000, for RCP 2.6 (blue) and RCP 8.5 emission scenarios (red; Kopp et al., 2014). Shading after the year 2000 indicates 17th to 83rd percentile range of RSL projections. (b) Annual mean RSL (in millimeters, with arbitrary offset) measured at 15 U.S. East Coast tide gauges (Holgate et al., 2013) with long and relatively complete records. (c) Linear trend in RSL along the U.S. East Coast from 1900Ð2017, in millimeters per year, from a Bayesian reconstruction (panel taken from Piecuch, Huybers, et al., 2018).

Understanding the drivers of future change in relative sea level (RSL, i.e., that observed by tide gauges and relevant to coastal locations; see Gregory et al., 2019), and the ability of numerical models to represent such drivers, is critical. However, this is a complex task, given the many contributing processes that operate over different temporal and spatial scales, including, for example: freshwater input from land and the cryosphere, thermal expansion of sea water, glacial isostatic adjustment, and oceanic mass and volume redistribution (see Kopp et al., 2015; Milne et al., 2009; Stammer et al., 2013, for more thorough reviews of these processes).

The relative contributions of these processes to U.S. East Coast RSL vary across space and through time. For example, vertical land motion (due primarily to glacial isostatic adjustment) accounts for the majority of the large-scale spatial variation in recent centennial trends and underlies the high rates of RSL rise in the Mid-Atlantic (Figure 1c; Karegar et al., 2017; Piecuch, Huybers, et al., 2018). However, ongoing climate-related processes - associated with net freshwater input, atmosphere-ocean momentum and buoyancy fluxes, and ocean mass and volume redistributionÑdominate the interannual to multidecadal, spatially variable, U.S. east coast RSL signals during the twentieth century (Figure 1b; Andres et al., 2013; Bingham & Hughes, 2009; Davis & Vinogradova, 2017; Ezer, 2013; Ezer et al., 2013; Frederikse et al., 2017; Goddard et al., 2015; Park & Sweet, 2015; Piecuch et al., 2016; Piecuch, Bittermann, et al., 2018; Piecuch & Ponte, 2015; Thompson & Mitchum, 2014; Woodworth et al., 2014; Yin & Goddard, 2013).

Of interest in this review paper is RSL variability related to changes in ocean circulation and density that may be causally coupled, or simply correlated, with the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC; see section 2). We thus focus on variability in "dynamic sea level" (DSL), that is, the height of the sea surface above the geoid, with the inverse barometer correction applied (Gregory et al., 2019). Secular DSL changes are evident in 21st century climate model simulations and are projected to be a principal driver of acceleration in 21st century sea level and its spatial variation along the east coast (Bilbao et al., 2015; Bouttes et al., 2014; Carson et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2018; Church et al., 2013; Kopp et al., 2014; Little, Horton, Kopp, Oppenheimer, Vecchi, et al., 2015; Little, Horton, Kopp, Oppenheimer, & Yip, 2015; Perrette et al., 2013; Slangen et al., 2014; Yin et al., 2009; Yin, 2012; Yin & Goddard, 2013). Various studies have shown these large-scale regional DSL anomalies to be correlated with a decline in AMOC strength (section 4). However, current-generation climate models also show a wide range in future projections of regional DSL rise. They may also exhibit systematic biases due to poorly resolved processes that influence near-coast DSL (section 6).

An improved theoretical and observational basis for AMOC-DSL relationships would enable assessments of the reliability of individual model projections, and climate models more generally, allowing improved estimates of the magnitude, spatial pattern, and time of emergence of expected sea level rise. In addition, a robust "signature" of AMOC (or some other feature of the large-scale circulation) in coastal RSL could be leveraged to infer preinstrumental changes in AMOC and/or climate. Recent improvements to analysis of the tide gauge record, including approaches to cope with data gaps and account for vertical land motion and glacial isostatic adjustment (Kopp, 2013; Piecuch, Huybers, et al., 2017), have intensified the interest in exploiting this relationship to inform reconstructions of ocean variability (e.g., Butler et al., 2015; Kienert & Rahmstorf, 2012; McCarthy et al., 2015). Proxies that predate the tide gauge record offer the opportunity to extend these reconstructions over centennial to millennial timescales (e.g., Kemp et al., 2017, 2018).

Here, motivated by these considerations, we review evidence for the covariation of AMOC and U.S. East Coast sea level. In section 2, we define AMOC and its relationship to the large-scale circulation of the North Atlantic Ocean. Section 3 presents a simple diagnostic scaling argument between AMOC strength and DSL. Section 4 surveys AMOC-DSL linkages in numerical simulations (where long-period relationships are able to be assessed) and includes a new analysis of the AMOC-DSL scaling coefficient in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) simulations. Section 5 examines observational linkages between AMOC components and coastal sea level, clarifying the specific components of AMOC (e.g., Gulf Stream) invoked, the regional fingerprint of such linkages, and the timescales over which the relationship has been documented. In section 6, we suggest potential origins of along-coast variations, intersimulation differences in scaling relationships, and discrepancies between models and observations; section 7 highlights new research directions that can help assess these discrepancies more extensively and quantitatively.

AMOC and the North Atlantic Ocean Circulation

The U.S. East Coast borders the western boundary of the North Atlantic Ocean, which is characterized by a spatially and temporally complex system of surface and deep currents (Figure 2).

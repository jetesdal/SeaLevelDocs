Abstract
--------

The Paris Agreement aims to limit global mean warming in the twenty-first century to less than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, and to promote further efforts to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius [1]. The amount of greenhouse gas emissions in coming decades will be consequential for global mean sea level (GMSL) on century and longer timescales through a combination of ocean thermal expansion and loss of land ice [2]. The Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) is Earth’s largest land ice reservoir (equivalent to 57.9 metres of GMSL) [3], and its ice loss is accelerating [4]. Extensive regions of the AIS are grounded below sea level and susceptible to dynamical instabilities [5,6,7,8] that are capable of producing very rapid retreat [8]. Yet the potential for the implementation of the Paris Agreement temperature targets to slow or stop the onset of these instabilities has not been directly tested with physics-based models. Here we use an observationally calibrated ice sheet–shelf model to show that with global warming limited to 2 degrees Celsius or less, Antarctic ice loss will continue at a pace similar to today’s throughout the twenty-first century. However, scenarios more consistent with current policies (allowing 3 degrees Celsius of warming) give an abrupt jump in the pace of Antarctic ice loss after around 2060, contributing about 0.5 centimetres GMSL rise per year by 2100—an order of magnitude faster than today [4]. More fossil-fuel-intensive scenarios [9] result in even greater acceleration. Ice-sheet retreat initiated by the thinning and loss of buttressing ice shelves continues for centuries, regardless of bedrock and sea-level feedback mechanisms [10,11,12] or geoengineered carbon dioxide reduction. These results demonstrate the possibility that rapid and unstoppable sea-level rise from Antarctica will be triggered if Paris Agreement targets are exceeded.

Introduction
------------

Most of the AIS terminates in the ocean, with massive ice shelves (floating extensions of glacial ice) providing resistance (buttressing) to the seaward flow of the grounded ice upstream [13]. About a third of the AIS rests on bedrock hundreds to thousands of metres below sea level [3], and in places where subglacial bedrock slopes downwards away from the ocean (reverse-sloped), the ice margin is susceptible to a marine ice-sheet instability (MISI) [5,6] and possibly a marine ice-cliff instability (MICI) [7,8]. The West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), which has the potential to cause about 5 m of GMSL rise, is particularly vulnerable. The WAIS is losing ice faster than other Antarctic sectors [4] and it sits in a deep basin >2.5 km below sea level in places [3].

Marine ice instabilities
------------------------

MISI and MICI can be triggered by the thinning or loss of buttressing ice shelves in response to a warming ocean, atmosphere or both [14]. MISI is related to a self-sustaining positive feedback between seaward ice flux across the grounding line (the boundary between grounded and floating ice) and ice thickness [5,6]. If buttressing is lost and retreat is initiated on a reverse-sloped bed, the retreating grounding line will encounter thicker ice, strongly increasing ice flow. Retreat will continue until the grounding line reaches forward-sloping bedrock, or sufficient resistive stress is restored by the regrowth of a buttressing ice shelf that is confined within coastal embayments or is thick enough to ‘pin’ on shallow bedrock features. Grounding lines on reverse-sloped bedrock are conditionally unstable15 and retreat at a rate determined by the complex interplay between ice flow and stress fields, bedrock conditions, surface mass balance and other factors that make model-ling these dynamics difficult.

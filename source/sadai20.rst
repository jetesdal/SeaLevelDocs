Abstract
--------

Meltwater and ice discharge from a retreating Antarctic Ice Sheet could have important impacts on future global climate. Here, we report on multi-century (present-2250) climate simulations performed using a coupled numerical model integrated under future greenhouse-gas emission scenarios IPCC RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, with meltwater and ice discharge provided by a dynamic-thermodynamic ice sheet model. Accounting for Antarctic discharge raises subsurface ocean temperatures by >1˚C at the ice margin relative to simulations ignoring discharge. In contrast, expanded sea ice and 2˚C to 10˚C cooler surface air and surface ocean temperatures in the Southern Ocean delay the increase of projected global mean anthropogenic warming through 2250. In addition, the projected loss of Arctic winter sea ice and weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation are delayed by several decades. Our results demonstrate a need to accurately account for meltwater input from ice sheets in order to make confident climate predictions.

Introduction
------------

Observational evidence indicates that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) is losing mass at an accelerating rate (1, 2). Recent advances in ice sheet modeling have improved our understanding of Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) evolution in response to anthropogenic greenhouse gas forcing and show that the AIS could contribute substantially to sea level rise by the end of this century (3-6). A more accurate understanding of the impacts that this evolution might have on atmospheric and oceanic dynamics is needed to constrain possible future changes in the climate system. However, ice sheet physics are not adequately represented in the current generation of global climate models (GCM) used in future projections (7, 8). The AIS is considered a tipping element within the climate system (9) with the potential to contribute several tens of centimeters of global mean sea level rise in the next two centuries, but the climate system response to such large-scale ice loss is not well constrained, especially beyond 2100.

Today, freshwater input to the ocean is increasing in response to climatic warming, largely from a combination of net precipitation and increasing riverine input resulting from an invigorated hydrologic cycle, and the loss of sea and land ice (10). Previous modeling work investigating the relative impacts of freshwater forcing in the North Atlantic versus the Southern Ocean (11, 12) has demonstrated that the location and magnitude of the additional freshwater are central to the modeled climate response. Methodology for modeling the climatic impact of freshwater perturbations has also varied widely in terms of strength, duration, and location of meltwater input: Historically, so-called "hosing" approaches added water uniformly within given latitude bands (11-14), while more recent work has applied freshwater forcing at specific locations around global coastlines or spread according to iceberg movements (6, 15-19). Despite differences in model resolution and representation of Earth system processes, several elements of the climate response to freshwater perturbations in the Southern Ocean have been broadly consistent, such as a decrease in surface air temperatures (SATs) over the Southern Ocean, a decrease in the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), and the expansion of Southern Ocean sea ice.

Here, we present results from a series of climate model simulations performed using a high-resolution, fully coupled, ocean-atmosphere-cryosphere-land model, Community Earth System Model (CESM) 1.2.2 with Community Atmospheric Model 5 (CAM5) atmospheric physics (20), under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP8.5 (10) spanning 2005-2250 (see Materials and Methods). In our freshwater forcing simulations, referred to throughout the paper as RCP4.5FW and RCP8.5FW, time-evolving freshwater (liquid melt-water and solid ice) input from Antarctica is provided from a continental ice sheet/ice shelf model (3) responding to the same atmospheric forcing scenarios. The control runs (RCP4.5CTRL and RCP8.5CTRL) have no additional freshwater forcing beyond what is already simulated by the CESM model. To account for spatial and temporal variations in runoff and to improve on classic hosing experiments, we released time-variant AIS meltwater and ice discharge into the ocean at the nearest surface-level coastal grid cell to where ice calving and/or ocean melt is occurring in the ice sheet model (Fig. 1A; see Materials and Methods) such that considerable volumes of meltwater and ice enter the ocean from the Amundsen Coast of West Antarctica, including Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers. In our experiments, liquid melt-water and solid ice discharge from the AIS are input separately to account for the latent heat of melting the solid component. In both RCP scenarios, the solid ice component dominates the discharge, with 62 to 87% of the total discharge being ice in RCP8.5FW and 71 to 86% in RCP4.5 (fig. S1). This is due to ice model advances that include hydrofracturing and ice-cliff calving. Here, we use the term "AIS discharge" to refer to the total freshwater forcing from the ice sheet model from both the solid ice and liquid meltwater components.

In RCP4.5FW, total discharge increases throughout the 21st century and remains between 0.4 and 0.8 sverdrup (sverdrup = 10^6 m^3/s) from 2050 to 2250; in contrast, the meltwater input in RCP4.5CTRL never exceeds 0.1 sverdrup (Fig. 1D). In RCP8.5FW, AIS discharge is dominated by the retreat of the WAIS in the ice sheet model during the 21st century, peaking at >2 sverdrup around ~2125 when the Ross Ice Shelf has collapsed and the inland ice behind it drains into the Ross Sea. Discharge then remains above 1 sverdrup through 2200 due to increasing contributions from the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS). This is in sharp contrast to RCP8.5CTRL in which discharge increases steadily throughout the run but never exceeds 0.2 sverdrup (Fig. 1D). As such, our methodology allows a direct comparison of the climate response to changing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations with and without a major Antarctic meltwater contribution that accounts for both the liquid meltwater and solid ice components of AIS discharge (see Materials and Methods). While projected changes in meltwater and ice discharge from Greenland are not included in our simulations, their potential impacts on climate are discussed in Materials and Methods.

(A) Spatially distributed, time-varying freshwater forcing from AIS discharge, which includes both the liquid meltwater and solid ice components, was input at the surface level around the continental margin. Forcing in September 2121 CE is shown here. (B) Combined liquid and solid forcing components are shown in relation to the global mean surface temperature in RCP8.5. Solid components are the dominant portion of the forcing, as seen in fig. S1.

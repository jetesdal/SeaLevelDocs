Abstract
--------

Under increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, ocean heat uptake moderates the rate of climate change, and thermal expansion makes a substantial contribution to sea level rise. In this paper we quantify the differences in projections among atmosphere-ocean general circulation models of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project in terms of transient climate response, ocean heat uptake efficiency and expansion efficiency of heat. The CMIP3 and CMIP5 ensembles have statistically indistinguishable distributions in these parameters. The ocean heat uptake efficiency varies by a factor of two across the models, explaining about 50% of the spread in ocean heat uptake in CMIP5 models with CO2 increasing at 1%/year. It correlates with the ocean global-mean vertical profiles both of temperature and of temperature change, and comparison with observations suggests the models may overestimate ocean heat uptake and underestimate surface warming, because their stratification is too weak. The models agree on the location of maxima of shallow ocean heat uptake (above 700 m) in the Southern Ocean and the North Atlantic, and on deep ocean heat uptake (below 2000 m) in areas of the Southern Ocean, in some places amounting to 40% of the top-to-bottom integral in the CMIP3 SRES A1B scenario. The Southern Ocean dominates global ocean heat uptake; consequently the eddy-induced thickness diffusivity parameter, which is particularly influential in the Southern Ocean, correlates with the ocean heat uptake efficiency. The thermal expansion produced by ocean heat uptake is 0.12 m YJ^{-1}, with an uncertainty of about 10% (1 YJ = 10^{24} J).

Introduction
------------

Ocean heat uptake moderates the rate of time-dependent climate change. Thermal expansion of sea-water is a consequence of ocean heat uptake and one of the major contributors to global-mean sea level rise [Church et al., 2011]. Our general aim in this paper is to quantify the differences in predictions of the magnitude and distribution of ocean heat uptake, and its consequences for global-mean surface air temperature change and thermal expansion, among atmosphereÐocean general circulation models (which we henceforth refer to simply as "models", for convenience) used for projections of anthropogenic climate change.

We analyse results from 22 models that participated in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3 (CMIP3), and from the 20 models in the CMIP5 project whose data were available at the time of writing this paper (Spring 2012). See Figure 1 and Table 1 in Text S1 in the auxiliary material, for a list.1 We mainly use the control experiments and experiments with atmospheric CO_2 concentration increasing at 1%/year (details in the auxiliary material).

Ocean Heat Uptake Efficiency and Transient Climate Response
-----------------------------------------------------------

Gregory and Forster [2008] showed that there is an approximately linear relationship between the global mean surface air temperature change \Delta T_a and the radiative forcing F (due to greenhouse gases etc.): \Delta T_a = F/\rho, with the climate resistance \rho in W m^{-2} K^{-1}. This relationship holds well for observations and model simulations of recent decades, and for projections of climate change under a continuously increasing forcing, which is a characteristic of most scenarios considered for the 21st century. The basis of this relationship is that the difference between the radiative forcing and the radiative feedback yields the net heat flux N into the climate system:

N = F - \Delta T_a, 

and N can be approximated by N \approx \kappa \Delta T_a. The climate resistance \rho is thus the sum of \alpha, the climate feedback parameter, and \kappa, which is identified as the ocean heat uptake efficiency because nearly all the added heat is stored in the ocean [e.g., Church et al., 2011].

Following Gregory and Forster [2008], the ocean heat uptake efficiency \kappa, the climate feedback parameter \alpha and the climate resistance \rho were calculated for CMIP5 by ordinary least squares regression (OLS) of decadal-mean N, F-N and F respectively against \Delta T_a under the standard idealized scenario of CO_2 increasing at 1% per year, giving a forcing F(t) = F_{2\times}t/70 which is linear with time t in years, where F_{2\times} is obtained from experiments in which CO_2 is instantaneously increased and then held constant [Andrews et al., 2012] (Table 1 in Text S1). The transient climate response (TCR) was calculated, following its definition, as \Delta T_a for the time-mean of years 61Ð80 in this scenario (Figure 1 and Table 1 in Text S1). The coefficient of variation (ratio of ensemble standard deviation to ensemble mean) of TCR is about 20% in CMIP5.

   Figure 1: The ocean heat uptake efficiency \kappa (blue bars), the climate feedback parameter \alpha (red bars), the transient climate response (crosses) and the expansion efficiency of heat \epsilon (circles) for the CMIP3 (numbers) and the CMIP5 (letters) models. The total bar length is the climate resistance \rho = \alpha + \kappa. The models are arranged in order of \kappa. See Table 1 in Text S1 in the auxiliary material for an alphabetical list of the models. It can be seen from this diagram that TCR and \kappa are anticorrelated (the crosses are further left towards the bottom), but there is no relationship between \kappa and \alpha or (the red bars and the circles do not show any tendency from top to bottom). For several technical reasons, not all parameters could be calculated for every model.

We see that \alpha obtained by this method agrees closely with \alpha obtained from the CO_2 step-increase experiments [Andrews et al., 2012]. F_{2\times} is not correlated with \alpha or \kappa. Whereas Gregory and Forster [2008] found \alpha and \kappa to be independent in CMIP3, they have a correlation of 0.56 in CMIP5, significant at the 5% level (one-tailed). This is due principally to the models GFDL-ESM2G and GFDL-ESM2M, which have \alpha and \kappa that are both larger than in any other model (except for \alpha of MIROC5). Without these models, the correlation is insignificant (0.32). Further investigation of these models is needed to establish whether there is a link between their large \alpha and large \kappa.
